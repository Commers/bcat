bcat reads from standard input and displays output in a web browser:

    $ echo "hi mom" |bcat
    $ echo "hi mom" |bcat -t 'Page Title'
    $ echo "*hi mom*" |markdown |bcat -h

Browser output is displayed progressively as it's read from standard input,
making bcat especially useful with build tools and commands like tail(1) that
generate output over longer periods of time:

    $ make all  |bcat
    $ rake test |bcat
    $ tail -f /var/log/syslog |bcat
