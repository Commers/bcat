bcat is a pipe to browser utility. It reads from standard input and displays
what it reads in a web browser:

    $ echo "hi mom" |bcat
    $ echo "hi mom" |bcat -t 'Important Message'

bcat assumes its input is plain text, but you can also pipe in HTML:

    $ echo "<h1>hi mom</h1>" |bcat -h
    $ echo "*hi mom*" |markdown |bcat -h

Browser output is displayed progressively as it's read from standard input,
making bcat especially useful with build tools and commands like tail(1) that
generate output over longer periods of time:

    $ make all  |bcat
    $ rake test |bcat
    $ tail -f /var/log/syslog |bcat
    $ (while printf .; do sleep 1; done) |bcat

See the bcat(1) manual for detailed command usage.

bcat is known to work under MacOS X, Linux, and FreeBSD (other UNIX-like
environments with freedesktop.org integration should work fine too). Progressive
output has been tested under Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and GNOME Epiphany.

See the INSTALLING, COPYING, and CONTRIBUTING files for information on those
things.

bcat was inspired by the HTML output capabilities included in TextMate
and a desire to have those capabilities from the shell and within editors
like Vim.
